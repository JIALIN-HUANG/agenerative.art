        The most famous, like Fountain of 1917, survived as data profiles, discursive figures made of text, photos, and
        “reenactments” or editions. Duchamp's readymade gave sculpture to data on two registers: He suspended matter
        between spade and sculpture and abandoned things for conversation. Descent and abandonment <br>
        Just over a century later, the NFT has come to undo Duchamp's gesture or complete late capitalism's cycle of
        information commodification. After all, the market will do its thing. NFT means non-fungible token. In order for
        it to be valuable, it must be controlled exclusively. This is absurd since this "non-fungible" coin is produced
        from photographs Beeple placed online in 2007 and could be collaged from iPhones across the globe. "Art" is used
        to turn Beeple's formerly transportable production into private property subject to excessive speculation. In
        other terms, art is non-fungible: Reverse premade. <br><br>
        <br><br>
        The NFT uses art to privatize publicly accessible data. <br>
        <br><br>
        Matter and property are political. Art may be a tool of extraction or, like Duchamp's work, destabilize the
        moment of substance becoming property. Such instability may address slavery's legacy (humans as property),
        economic inequality (labor as property), and colonial connections in the museum (race becoming property). Or the
        aesthetics of such incompletions of transitions of matter into property and property into matter? This question
        has no clear answer. Such an aesthetics must be based on spectatorial generosity, where one matches the artist's
        gift with the gift of one's time. If our seeing refuses to be possessive—if it explores an item as a material
        zone of endless event—appropriation will be impossible. Because enough individuals agreed, Everydays is
        non-fungible. Rather, all of the photos in this piece were previously used to communicate online. The NFT favors
        property above material experience. This contract is void.
