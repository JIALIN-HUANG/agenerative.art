        "It is the function of realistic representation which
        turns out to be more and more
        obsolete, whereas new viewing angles become legitimised (Degas"
        frames) and the operational method of the camera-the rendering of
        the real through the impact of light-grounds the pictorial practice of
        the impressionist. Subsequently, modern painting would focus its
        issues on what it contains in terms of scaling things down to
        mechanical recording (matter, and gesture, which would give rise to
        abstract art). Then, in a third phase, artists would appropriate
        photography as an image-producing technique. These three attitudes
        which, where photography is concerned, followed on one from the
        other in time,
        may nowadays occur either simultaneously or
        alternately, helped by a speeding-up of exchanges. Every technical
        innovation that has taken place since the Second World War has thus
        caused a wide range of reactions among artists, from the adoption of
        predominant production methods (the "mec-art" of the sixties), to the
        preservation, come what may, of the pictorial tradition (the
        "purist"
        formalism championed by Clement Greenberg)."

        My refelction:
        <br><br>
        
        Photography accomplished a different kind of photographic "Super Realism" on Cyberpunk. First, let me explain
        Surrealism, it is a movement born after the First World War and before the Second World War, which defined
        itself as a movement of emancipation of the individual, free from the medium or limits of a single style.
        Examples include The Persistence of Memory (Fig 2) and photographer Philippe Halsman(Fig 3), where the melting
        clock is an exploration of persistence in memory, and Philippe Halsman's photography, which chooses to depict
        everything as a semi-suspension of reality. Both works bypass the grip of consciousness to release the
        unconscious. Cyberpunk, however, is an illusion of technological degradation, a concern and reflection on
        technological developments related to the environment, politics, religion, and the humanities. The classic film
        Ghost in the Shell, for example, is a re-questioning of three philosophical questions: who am I, where do I come
        from, and where am I going. Another example of Cyberpunk is Blade Runner 2049 is a film that asks the question,
        "what is humanity?” when technology has reached a certain level of development. In the book On Photography,
        Sontag wrote “...a revival of Photo-Realism which is not content with merely imitating photographs but aims to
        show that painting can achieve an even greater illusion of verisimilitude, painting is still largely ruled by a
        suspicion of what Duchamp called the merely retinal. ” (P74, Sontag) Art completes the visual construction of
        surrealism, a visual aspect that expresses an unconscious awareness. Cyberpunk, while presenting this profound
        philosophical view of things, uses a full range of digital images to bring a new digital spectacle to the
        viewer, that is, an impactful view of things that are difficult to see in real life, brought to the viewer in
        the form of a picture. The visual aspect of cyberpunk has been instrumental in bringing it from a previous
        subculture to a familiar spectacle.
