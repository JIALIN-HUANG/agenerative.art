        "Let us, as the Chinese say, move our chairs closer to the
        fire and see what we are saying. The electric changes associated
        with automation have nothing to do with ideologies or social
        programs. If they had, they could be delayed or controlled. In-
        stead, the technological extension of our central nervous system
        that we call the electric media began more than a century ago,
        subliminally. Subliminal have been the effects. Subliminal they
        remain. At no period in human culture have men understood the
        psychic mechanisms involved in invention and technology. Today
        it is the instant speed of electric information that, for the furst
        time, permits easy recognition of the patterns and the formal
        contours of change and development. The entire world, past and
        present, now reveals itself to us like a growing plant in an enor-
        mously accelerated movie. Electric speed is synonymous with light
        and with the understanding of causes. So, with the use of elec-
        tricity in previously mechanized situations, men easily discover
        causal connections and patterns that were quite unobservable
        at the slower rates of mechanical change."
