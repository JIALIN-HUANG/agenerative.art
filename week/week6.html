    <h1>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Reading Reflection</h1>

    <li class="quote">
        Gerstner redefined the graphic designer as a problem solver by adopting a more holistic, scientific approach to
        design. <br><br>
        Design evolves from a succession of styles and approaches to a process and method for solving recurrent
        challenges. One might argue graphic design moves from product to process or object to tool. <br><br>
        Who produces the concept, if it's the machine that makes art? <br><br>
        Conceptual art's subjective component begins with the creator. The creators of conditional design believe that
        "even if a process appears objective, we recognize that it comes from subjective goals." Once started, LeWitt
        considered the process mechanical and unchangeable. It must end." 7 This lack of artist influence in the outcome
        might be regarded as an acceptance of a machine-age modernism that believes exactitude of input can consistently
        anticipate output, or as a purposeful effort to incorporate uncontrollable and unpredictable variables that can
        change the course of events. The latter sees the process as a chance to test and perhaps undermine assumptions,
        whereas the former sees it as a closed, predictable mechanism for faithfully replicating goals. LeWitt's
        ""Conceptual art is only excellent when the idea is good" echoes "garbage in, garbage out" in computing.
