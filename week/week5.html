            We developed these elements of theory in our work on design methods in recent years.
            We believe them to be useful and of general interest to all physical design disciplines.

            The concept central to all making, using and designing of artifacts is that of control. To be
            a maker, user or designer one must have control over the artifact or some of its parts. The control of the
            designer is not necessarily a matter of physically moving stones, sticks and bolts -- although such actions
            may well be part of designig.
