        Computers are amazing information processors, but they are also cultural toys. Computer games and amusements
        still dominate mass-market sales. When we "play" with them, we obey "totally binding" logical norms of
        information processing. Moreover, as play, this rule-governed activity justifies itself. We do it because "it's
        there" and we can. Therein lies the impression of pleasure as the psychological partner of computer play: the
        captivation, tension, delight, and awareness of play's distinctiveness from "regular life" <br><br>
        More than psychology is involved. Play implies looseness. A loose nut in a machine plays; a loose nut disrupts
        social order; a poor pun plays with word meanings. Such looseness in today's information originates from its
        lack of closure in knowledge, the arbitrariness of symbols, and the union of digital symbol with electronic
        computer, whose high-speed, algorithmic, iterating capacities may develop fresh forms of information. <br><br>
        Profusion, complexity, and emergence are three aspects of play that characterize our period. Each of these
        concepts extracts a deeper and richer vein of intellectual and cultural Mplay from the computer's
        micro-informational capability. The use of raw computer power in digitizing macro-information resulted in these
        expansions. Play provides knowledge with power. Together, they have severed information from its centuries-old,
        intuitive meaning as the molded or informed kernel of content we derive from experience. Now, logical rules,
        technological speed, power, and play bracket our global exchanges.<br><br>
